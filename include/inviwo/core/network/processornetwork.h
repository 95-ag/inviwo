/**
 * This class manages the current processor network. It can be thought of as a container of
 * Processor instances, which Port instances are connected through PortConnection instances,
 * and which Property instances are linked through ProcessorLink instances. To manage Processors,
 * PortConnections and ProcessorLinks, add and remove methods are available for all
 * these entities. The network should be only modified by using these methods. Typically,
 * these methods are called by the NetworkEditor, which enables the user to edit
 * ProcessorNetworks.
 *
 * When the PorcessorNetwork has been changed, it is flagged as modified. This mechanism is
 * used by the ProcessorNetworkEvaluator to identify if the ProcessorNetwork needs to be
 * analyzed before processing.
 *
 * In the model view controller design pattern, the ProcessorNetwork represents the model,
 * which means that no graphical representations are generated for the added entities. Adding
 * and removing of the graphical representations is done in the NetworkEditor.
